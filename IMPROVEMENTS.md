# Snake Game Improvement Ideas

Here are some ideas for improving the user experience of the snake game.

### Visual and Audio Feedback

*   **Sound Effects:** Add sound effects for key events like eating food, eating super food, game over, and maybe a subtle sound for changing direction. This would make the game more engaging.
*   **Visual Polish:**
    *   **Animated Food:** Make the food pulsate or gently rotate to make it more visually appealing.
    *   **Screen Shake:** A subtle screen shake on game over could add more impact.
    *   **Particle Effects:** When the snake eats food, you could have some particles burst out.

### Gameplay Enhancements

*   **Power-ups:** Introduce more types of power-ups besides the "Super Snake" mode. For example:
    *   **Slow-down:** A power-up that temporarily slows down the snake.
    *   **Shrink:** A power-up that makes the snake shorter.
    *   **Bonus Points:** A power-up that gives a large number of points.
*   **Obstacles:** Add obstacles to the game board that the snake has to avoid. These could be static or moving.
*   **Level Progression:** Instead of just having difficulty settings, you could have levels that get progressively harder. Each level could have a different layout, speed, and set of obstacles.
*   **Leaderboard:** Implement a global leaderboard to encourage competition among players.

### UI/UX Improvements

*   **Clearer Button States:** The "Borders" button could be more explicit, perhaps saying "Borders: On" or "Borders: Off".
*   **Mobile Controls:** For mobile users, instead of relying on swipes, you could add on-screen arrow buttons for more precise control.
*   **Pause on Blur:** The game should automatically pause when the window loses focus (e.g., when the user switches to another tab).
*   **Settings Menu:** Instead of having the difficulty and border controls directly on the main screen, you could move them to a settings menu. This would clean up the main UI.

### Code and Performance

*   **Refactor `script.js`:** The `script.js` file is quite large. It could be broken down into smaller modules for better organization and maintainability. For example, you could have separate modules for game logic, drawing, UI, and input handling.
*   **State Management:** The game state is currently managed by a large number of global variables. Using a state management pattern (like a state machine or a simple state object) would make the code cleaner and less prone to bugs.
